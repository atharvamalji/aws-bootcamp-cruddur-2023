# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Atharva Malji here and this is my week 0 homework. I was caught up in my classes and project work so finally getting a start on this one

I had previously used lucidcharts for my personal and university projects but today I was really able to see that it offers much more things than I initally used it for.

Anyways here's the diagram that I created. It's quite similar to andrew's but I was able to learn a lot never the less.
